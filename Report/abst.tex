In this report we discuss the methodology behind implementing a particular system using matlab code. 
The aim of this project is to utilize built in libraries and functions from matlab for the purpose of creating a software system capable of emulating a message being transmitted and received electronically. There are many built in capabilities and software packages that are capable of creating such an emulator, we are using matlab because of its helpful built in features for designing filters and other critical components.
