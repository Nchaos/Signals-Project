The nature of this paper is laid out by the four internal sections, each describes the process undergone for implementing the particular component of the system.
Due to the tiered nature of this project, each section of the report is broken down further into four subsections, indicating the difficulty level of each contribution made to the overall component.

The system that we are implementing begins at a very simple level. The stages of the project are re-iterated here:
